Hey! I'm Luc 👋

I recently graduated from Le Wagon's (LW) Full Stack Web Dev bootcamp. I'm passionate about UX and product design 🎰, and I love the logic used for coding back-end features. 🧰

To continue my learning, I will be embarking on Project Vibez 2.0. Vibez is the app myself and my team built for our LW final project - you can see the repo for that one already. Vibez was my idea and I have lots more features that I would like to build, which I will do in Vibez 2.0 - as you will see! 🚀
