**Hey! I'm Luc** ðŸ‘‹

In June I graduated from Le Wagon's (LW) Full Stack Web Dev bootcamp. I'm passionate about UX and product design ðŸŽ°, and I love the process of building tech products ðŸ§°

I've been fixing up by LW project, Vibez ðŸ’–, most recently. My next coding goal is to build an app that converts excerpts of books into handy flashcards, so you don't forget those cool non-fiction factoids! ðŸ¤“
